# Ender's Random Items Mod
A minecraft mod with the purpose of nothing whatsoever, it will contain several blocks and items that will do different things.

Current items and blocks include:

Tesseracts: Blocks that when right-clicked give you a potion effect,
think of it sort of like a mini beacon.

Moist towelette: A crafting item to be used with rotten flesh to make something slightly more edible.

Sanitizing water: Crafting item.

Puffballs: Small 'foxes' that stay in your inventory and when held in your offhand give you special potion effects.

Stone Stick: Crafting item.

Stone Chisel: Used to craft 6 stone sticks by right-clicking a stone block.

Stone Torch: Basically a torch made with stone rather than wood.

Questionable Cheese: Throw it on a beacon.

FLARD: It is literally a lucky block in an item form.
