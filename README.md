# Ender's Random Items Mod
A minecraft mod with the purpose of nothing whatsoever, it will contain several blocks and items that will do different things.

Current items and blocks include:

Tesseracts: Blocks that when right-clicked give you a potion effect,
think of it sort of like a mini beacon.

Moist towelette: A crafting item to be used with rotten flesh to make something slightly more edible.

Sanitizing water: Crafting item.
